# Etch-A-Sketch

Can you handle a virtual canvas? Ready, set, create!

### 🕹️ How to Play

1. Open the [game](https://dttncl.github.io/etch-a-sketch/) in your browser
2. Select a sketch size (Small - 50x50, Normal - 16x16, Large - 10x10)
3. Choose your desired pen color
4. Start sketching by dragging your cursor
5. Switch between eraser and sketch mode as you go!

### 🛠️ Implementation
This is my take on Etch-A-Sketch with colors resembling the vibrant childhood I had.
HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used to create the virtual canvas. Sketching was made through DOM EventListeners.
